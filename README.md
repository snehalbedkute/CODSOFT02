##  Task Title: Linear Regression on IMDb Indian Movies Dataset

---

##  Aim

The aim of this task is to apply a **Linear Regression** model on a dataset of Indian movies from IMDb. The objective is to understand how different features of movies (such as votes, duration, etc.) can be used to predict a continuous target variable, likely the IMDb rating. This task showcases the practical use of supervised machine learning algorithms.

##  Dataset

- **Name:** `IMDb Movies India.csv`  
- **Description:** A dataset containing key attributes of Indian movies like title, genre, duration, rating, and votes.

---

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy` 
- `matplotlib.pyplot` 
- `seaborn` 
- `sklearn.model_selection` 
- `sklearn.linear_model`
- `sklearn.metrics`

---

## Task Summary

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas` and examined the first few rows.

2. **Data Exploration & Cleaning:**
   - Explored the structure and distribution of features.
   - Checked for missing or inconsistent data and cleaned accordingly.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Selected numeric and relevant features that contribute to the prediction of IMDb rating.

4. **Data Splitting:**
   - Divided the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Trained a Linear Regression model using `LinearRegression()` from `sklearn`.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
   - Visualized predictions using scatter plots and regression lines to interpret model performance.

---

##  Output

- The model was successfully trained and tested on the dataset.
- Plots and metrics indicated the relationship between input features and the target variable.
- The model's performance was assessed using error metrics and visual validation.

##  Conclusion

This task demonstrates the step-by-step process of building and evaluating a **Linear Regression** model using a real-world dataset. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model validation. The outcome shows how machine learning can help predict numeric outcomes like IMDb ratings based on related features.
